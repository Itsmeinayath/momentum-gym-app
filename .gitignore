=========================================================================

This is a comprehensive .gitignore file for a standard Node.js project.

It's designed to keep your repository clean, secure, and professional.

Dependencies

Ignore the folder where all third-party code (from npm) is installed.

This folder is generated by running npm install.

node_modules/

Environment Variables

NEVER commit your secrets (API keys, database passwords, etc.) to Git.

These files store sensitive information specific to your local machine.

.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local

.env.*.local

Production & Build Artifacts

These folders contain the final, optimized code for deployment.

They are generated from your source code and should not be tracked.

/build/
/dist/
.next/
.nuxt/
.vercel/

Logs

Log files are generated during runtime and are not part of the source code.

They can become very large and are specific to a single session or machine.

logs/
.log
npm-debug.log
yarn-debug.log*

Caches store temporary data to speed up processes. They can be safely ignored.
